### How Is Machine Learning Different from Traditional Software?

In machine learning, a  version  of  the  code  and  a  version  of  the  data  together  produce  a  version of the ML model.

## The MLOps Workflow

### What Is the Point of MLOps?

Therefore, time to market should be the number one metric to look at and optimize for any ML project.

### Risks MLOps workflow tackles

1. Loss of knowledge
    - We recommend a version control system that can track your whole pipeline from raw data to the model, including your code, environment, configurations, and parameters.
2. Failures in production
    - Ensure that the data used to train a model looks like you expected it to.
    - Ensure that the model works not only in training but in a real-world environment.
    - Ensure that the infrastructure works consistent.
3. Regulatory and ethical
    - While MLOps can’t fix model biases, it comes with the notion that these concerns should be addressed by codifying tests for them into a machine learning pipeline.
4. Data security

### Time to Market

- To get a truly scalable business model around ML usually requires that you step back and think of your product in terms of the pipeline instead of a single instance of a trained model.
- Broadly speaking, there are two ways that MLOps helps accelerate the time to market of machine learning:
    1. It creates a shared language among the extended team.
        - Modern tooling and shared work methods (CI/CD, version control, microservices) have enabled companies to scale their throughput in software development exponentially.
    2. It automates manual tasks.
        - Automation of collecting data, training, and evaluating models allows the most scarce resources, i.e. data scientists, to focus their efforts on further development.
        - However, in the most extreme cases, your model needs to be updated all the time to keep up with the pace at which the underlying data is changing.

### The MLOps Workflow Enforces Best Practices

- Version  control  everything,  including  models,  code,  data, parameters, and environment. Enable anyone to trace how a model was produced.
- Componentize the steps of the model creation process and build them into a pipeline. A single notebook is not a pipeline.
- Codify testing. With checkpoints and safeguards in place, there is a standard that models have to adhere to.
- Automate work to increase how much time can be spent on future development.

## How to Quantify Success in an MLOps Project?

Only a model that is running in production can bring value.

Here are three steps to get started:

1. Define your objective and clear, concrete, and measurable metrics with all the relevant stakeholders
    - Ensure everyone understands the “why” behind the project (...)
    - Document and share how the work is currently done (...) and what it will take to replace the current way of working.
    - Uncover assumptions that different team members have (...)
2. Measure the success of different stages of the project (...)
    - It will be hard to estimate the total time it will take to deliver
    - Make sure you split your project into smaller pieces to validate your assumptions, track your progress, and gather feedback.
    - (...) make sure you reflect on your progress and whether you’re heading in
the right direction to solve the original issue. Don’t be afraid to go back to defining the problem. Document the lessons you’ve learned and place them in an internal Wiki for other teams to learn from.
3. Have a multi-disciplinary team with clear roles and responsibilities
    - (...) measure how well your team is working together.
    - Make sure everyone understands each other’s roles and responsibilities in this project.
    - Involve IT early on
